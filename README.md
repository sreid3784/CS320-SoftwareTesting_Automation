How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
How do I approach designing software?

In this class we learned so much about how to integrate sound development techniques like testing strategies, and iterative development that it has changed the way I think about software development. The best way to ensure you program is secure is by building a little at a time, testing those bits, and then re-using that approach in each iteration or release. You incorporate user requirements into the testing strategy by writing test cases that are designed to ensure those requirements are met. We can use various methods within Junit to accomplish this task. I am growing in my ability to design software and in this class I learned to make software in chunks and taking care in how features are developed. I will also ensure that I do not design too much in one shot and make sure to always design test cases that link back tot he requirements given.
